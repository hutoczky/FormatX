# PR: Fix UI wiring, enforce Hungarian localization, unify Disk Health and Secure Erase UI

Branch: fix/ui-visual-i18n-unify

Summary
- Enforced full Hungarian UI across Disk Health and Secure Erase.
- Replaced hard-coded strings with resource lookups; added Strings.hu/en keys.
- Unified labels, tooltips, and AutomationProperties in XAML.
- Health badge shows non-interactive status: "Állapot: Jó" with colored dot.
- Normalized lifecycle logs for CI (usb.app.start / usb.app.shutdown) and made audit robust.
- UI audit whitelist updated for new control names.

Key Changes
- MainWindow.xaml: UI text clean-up, new names: BtnSurfaceScan, BtnSmartQuery, BytesToScan, HealthStatusText, BtnHealthDetails.
- MainWindow.xaml.cs: resource-based texts; health status binding fix; audit whitelist extended.
- Resources/Strings.hu.resx, Resources/Strings.en.resx: new keys for Disk Health & Secure Erase.
