Summary
- Branch: fix/ui-clarity-and-stability
- Scope: crash hardening (WinRT/COM), bilingual UI clarity (hu/en), UI audit whitelist update, visual unification (rounded buttons), and verification.
- Key fixes:
  * Guarded WinAppSDK Bootstrap.Initialize to prevent 0xC000027B.
  * Added WinRtGuard to DeviceWatcher, File/Folder pickers and image loads with area-aware logging.
  * Default timeouts and cancellation handling for long-running WinRT calls.
  * DispatcherQueue and UI null guards; TryGracefulShutdown gated by FORMATX_HEADLESS.
  * All user-visible strings moved to Strings.hu/Strings.en resources and ApplyUiText used.
  * Health status chip bound to localized HealthStatus_* keys and implemented as non-interactive chip.
  * UI audit whitelist updated; audit emits usb.ui.audit.begin/end and usb.ui.check.present/missing safely.
  * Theme: shared Button style with CornerRadius=8 applied across app.
- Verification performed
  * dotnet restore/build: success
  * dotnet publish -c Release -r win-x64 -p:Platform=x64: success
  * tests/run-audit.ps1 and tests/smoke-test.ps1: PASS
  * tests/final-result.txt: PASS
